Code of Conduct
=========================================

The Matrix Profile Foundation (MPF) community is made up of members from around the globe with a
diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through
these differences that our community experiences success and continued
growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines
when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community.
Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing
community.

A member of the MPF community is:

Open
----

Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether on patches,
reporting issues, asking for help or otherwise. We welcome those
interested in joining the community, and realize that including people
with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our
community.

We are accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities,
fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can
make a difference, ensuring that all participants are heard and feel
confident that they can freely express their opinions.

Considerate
-----------

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other
developers, users, etc. We are thoughtful when addressing the efforts of
others, keeping in mind that often the labor was completed simply for
the good of the community. We are attentive in our communications,
whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching
differing views.

We recognize the work made by everyone and ensure the proper
acknowledgement/citation of original authors at all times. As authors,
we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
acknowledged.

Respectful
----------

Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others,
their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We
are respectful of the volunteer and professional efforts within the
community. We are respectful of the processes set forth in the
community, and we work within them (paying particular attention to those
new to the community).

Behavior Examples
-----------------

Examples of encouraged behavior include:

-  Using welcoming and inclusive language
-  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-  Focusing on what is best for the community
-  Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-  Public or private harassment
-  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
-  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

MPF Leadership Pledge & Responsibilities
----------------------------------------

We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and
to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We
will take action when members of our community violate this code and ask
that such violations be reported to mpf.conduct@gmail.com (all emails
sent to this address will be treated with the strictest confidence) or
talking privately.

We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

CoC Scope
---------

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
